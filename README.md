# Awesome Movies

This is just my study about Android development.
Here I used the following plugins:

- Retrofit: For making http requests to OMDB Database.
- ReactiveX: To make Retrofit's responses more reactive.
- ButterKnife: To bind activity components easily and faster than associate them on Activity.onCreate.
- FontAwesome: Just to make Icons easier and lighter.
- Picasso: To load icons to buttons and images from the movies.

Please feel free to use this app to your study or even make suggestions. I would be happy if I could help someone ;)
